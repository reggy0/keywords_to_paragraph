Output:A network system managing an on-demand service within a geographic region can receive, over a network, multi-user request data corresponding to a request for service for a plurality of users. The request data can indicate one or more start locations, a plurality of users, and one or more service locations. In response to receiving the request data, the network system can select a set of service providers from a plurality of candidate service providers in the geographic region to provide the requested service. The service providers can be selected based on optimizations of one or more service parameters including estimated fares for the plurality of users, ETAs to the start location, ETAs to the service locations, etc. The network system can further determine routes for the set of service providers from their respective locations to the start or service location(s) and from the start or

Keywords:Portable device,Wireless connectivity,Security device,Provides multi-factor authentication,authentication,Use biometric 
Output:A portable security device with wireless connectivity that provides multi-factor authentication for online access. It has a built-in method of use that allows users to authenticate their identity using biometric factors. The device also uses proximity with mobile devices as an additional authentication factor, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access the device. Overall, the device is designed to provide a high level of security for online access and is particularly well-suited for users who need to access sensitive information or systems remotely.
###
Keywords:Systems and methods,telecommunication,Telecommunication services,Patient's access,Healthcare consultations,Performance 
Output:Systems and methods for improving a User access to the services offered by one or more service providers utilizing on-demand remote telecommunication is provided. In an example application, a User seeking legal service,obtains access to services offered by one or more attorneys thru telecommunication services.In another example, patient's access to healthcare providers is improved by managing on-demand services thru sharing access to healthcare providers utilizing telecommunication platforms, including telehealth and telemedicine.In a healthcare example embodiment, a networked system receives an indication of on-demand search being performed at a User device to remotely locate one or more healthcare providers for online consultations with the User.Search device provides a plurality of terms, including Provider's skills, consultation cost, performance reviews, and geographical location.The networked system performs the search that corresponds to the terms provided.A result of the search is presented on the User device.
